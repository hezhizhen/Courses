# chapter 1 : The Role of Algorithms in Computing

- What are Algorithms?
- Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile?
- What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers?

## 1.1 Algorithms

algorithm(informally):

- an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**
- a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output
- a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem (the statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship, and the algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship)

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
